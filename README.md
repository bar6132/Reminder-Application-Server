# Reminder-Application-Server
The Reminder Application is a web-based tool built using Python Django Rest Framework (DRF) for the backend and React for the frontend. This application allows users to create, manage, and receive reminders for important tasks, events, or appointments.


Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository
  Open your terminal or command prompt.
  Navigate to the directory where you want to store your Python project. You can use the cd command to change directories.
  Clone the GitHub repository using the following command, replacing repository_url with the actual URL of the repository you want to clone
  <git clone repository_url>
  
Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment:
  cd <repository-name>
  python -m venv venv
  #Activate the virtual environment:
    venv\Scripts\activate

Step 3: Install Dependencies
    While the virtual environment is active, you can now install the project's dependencies using pip. Usually, a Python project includes a requirements.txt file that lists all the dependencies.
    Run the following command to install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
